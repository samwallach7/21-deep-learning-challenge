Attached please find the documents for the Module 21 Challenge:
  - The 'Starter_Code.ipynb' file which features the Preprocessing and the initial model setup.
  - The 'AlphabetSoupCharity.h5' file which features the results of the initial model.
  - The 'Optimization_Attempts' folder which includes three Jupyter Notebook files (one for each optimization attempt) and the resulting h5 file for each attempt.
  - The 'Deep_Learning_Challenge_Report.docx' file which explains the model and the evaluation process.

    Thank you!
